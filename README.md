The purpose of this analysis is to examine the **spatial concentration of employment** in the Netherlands across provinces, focusing on two contrasting industries:  

- **A — Agriculture, forestry and fishing**  
- **Q — Health and social work activities**  

These industries were assigned to **Group 7** in the *Regional and Urban Economics* tutorial (Week 3). The exercise applies regional economics indicators to measure **specialization, concentration, and diversification**, connecting theory to empirical data from **CBS StatLine (2024)**.

The assignment corresponds to the following questions:
- (a) Data preparation and assumptions
- (b) Location quotients (LQ)
- (c) Hirschman–Herfindahl Index (HHI) and Lorenz curves
- (d) Interpretation and theoretical discussion
